# Interpret a Data Visualization Dashboard
## Project description
A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. 
The project consists in finding three insights in the visualizations. 

For each insight, provide a static image that shares what you found. Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. 

## About the data
